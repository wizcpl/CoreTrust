# CoreTrust - App, as OS with Console!
### How did I come up with the idea to make an operating system simulator on a computer?
- Idk, I was inspired by jailbreak on iOS, and thought: "Why don't I make my own OS?", but remembered that I've never worked with OS development. Maybe in the future, I will start work with it.

### How long have I been developing on c++?
- About a year.
